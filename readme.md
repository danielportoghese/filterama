# WCM Filterama

> Adds one taxonomy filter/drop-down/select box for each taxonomy attached to a
(custom) post types list in the admin post list page. Also adds a "match" button
so you can now "filter" the list by ALL or ANY taxonomy terms.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Filterama doesn't work with my Custom Post Types!

Make sure that your Custom Post Type Taxonomy declares 
`show_admin_column => true` in its `$args` array. 
Filterama will only hook those taxonomies with `show_admin_column` set to true. 

## Security Issues

**Do not!** use the issue tracker if you find a security issue. Those are public. 
Please instead send an email to the address that you can read

that exploit on your site as well. Thank you in advance.
